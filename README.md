# logging-change-in-data
Excel practice. Highlights: Macro, VBA coding, If statements

Here is a simple calculation table. With a input you will get a output. 
However, I would like to record my input and my output in a list. 

I tried to use if statement to isolate the number in the result cell in V1, it did not work
I then used Macro to copy and specialpasted only the number in V2. It worked. 

A button is needed to confirm the logging of the data. This is due to my VBA code requires an 'enter' action performed by the user. 
I used Macro to record my action. 

See V3 for final demonstration. Use the roller to change the number, and click button to log data in data log.
